# Tandy 1000HX BIOS

## What is this

The Tandy 1000hx BIOS disassembled.

This is still WIP.

## TODO:

- Finish analyzing graphics code
- Finish analyzing EEPROM code
- Finish analyzing keyboard code
- Analyze all the floppy disk handler
- And analyze what's left
- Review IDA Pro autogenerated comments. Some of them are not valid for the Tandy
- And probably much more


## How to read it

- Open the [.lst file][5] with a text editor
- Or open the [.idb][6] file with [IDA Pro][3] (I used the [freeware version][4])


## EEPROM

There are 4 words (1 word == 2 bytes) to store data.
